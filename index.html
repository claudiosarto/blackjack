        <h1>Dealer Cards:</h1>
        <div id="rules">
            <p>In blackjack, the goal is to obtain a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. 
                The "17 rule" refers to the dealer's strategy of hitting or standing based on a specific total in their hand. 
                Here are the basic rules for playing blackjack with the "dealer hits on soft 17" rule:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Objective: Get a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.</li>
                    <li>Card Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.</li>
                            <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10.</li>
                            <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable.</li>
                        </ul>                    
                    </li>
                    <li>Gameplay
                        <ul>
                            <li>Players place their bets before the cards are dealt.</li>
                            <li>The dealer deals two cards to each player, including themselves. Both player cards are usually face-up, while one of the dealer's cards may be face-down (hole card).</li>
                            <li>The player's turn comes first:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The player can either "hit" (receive an additional card) or "stand" (keep their current total).</li>
                                    <li>Other options may include "double down" (double the initial bet, receive one more card, then stand) or "split" (if the player's initial two cards are of equal value, they can split them into two separate hands and play each hand independently).</li>
                                    <li>The player can continue to hit until they choose to stand or until their hand total exceeds 21, resulting in a bust and an automatic loss.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Dealer's Turn:
                        <ul>
                            <li>After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals the face-down card.</li>
                            <li>The dealer continues to hit until their hand total is at least 17 or higher. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust, and all remaining players win.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Winning:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Players win if their hand total is higher than the dealer's without going over 21.</li>
                            <li>If the player's hand matches the dealer's total, it's a push (tie), and the player neither wins nor loses their bet.</li>
                            <li>If the player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and automatically lose, regardless of the dealer's hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
